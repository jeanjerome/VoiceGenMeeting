Emma: Alex, how is the report I asked you for last week coming along?
Alex: Let's say conceptually, it's done. Practically, there are a few details left.
Emma: "A few details" like... writing it entirely?
Alex: I prefer to say its physical manifestation is delayed.
Emma: The meeting is in fifteen minutes.
Alex: Perfect! That's exactly the time I need to give my best.
